This is a really hacky way of doing things, but I didn't have the foresight to think I might want to track a few files above my home directory.  Anyway, it's only a few.

- `/usr/share/themes/.` Where thunar icon theme & cursor them are stored.  Perhaps I can move at a later date.
- `/usr/share/endeavours/backgrounds/` Due to a glitch in the lockscreen conf, I have to mess with the file `endeavouros-wallpaper.png` and just set that to point to to whatever lockscreen img I'd like to be using.
